I am Blaine Knapp, MBA CMC, a retired management consultant, interested in trading stocks.
I have developed a proof-of-concept stock tracking system using Excel and VBA.
It handles foreign currencies and separates trading gains/losses from FX gains/losses.
I am interested in Visual Studio, dotNet MAUI and C#
